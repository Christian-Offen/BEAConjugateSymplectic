We illustrate a new technique for backward error analysis which systematically determines modified symplectic structures and modified Hamiltonians for conjugate symplectic methods. 

Please refer to the Mathematica Notebook *Symmetric_MultiStep_BEA_Matrix.nb* for the computation of modified data for multistep methods with matrix valued coefficients and to *ModQuantities.ipynb* for numerical experiments with the modified quantities.
